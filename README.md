This project might help you pass the Cloudera Certified Spark and Hadoop Developer (CCA175) using Pyspark

This repository is comprised of all the notes i have gathered preparing for the exam and would serve as a good starting point for the developers who are starting from scratch.

Extensive hands-on exercises to be solved before appearing for the exam and their respective solutions are included as Jupyter notebook, to be able to spin it up easily.
All the learnings and the solutions are in dataframe APIs.


If this project helps you to clear CCA175 with flying colors, you can give me a cup of coffee :)
