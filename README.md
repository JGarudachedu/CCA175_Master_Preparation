This project might help you pass the Cloudera Certified Spark and Hadoop Developer (CCA175) using Pyspark
This material is of all the notes i have gathered preparing for the exam. 
Extensive exercises to be solved before appearing for the exam and the solutions are also shared in Jupyter notebook.
All the learnings and the solutions are in dataframe APIs and not in RDD APIs unfortunately.


If this project helps you to clear CCA175 with flying colors, you can give me a cup of coffee :)
